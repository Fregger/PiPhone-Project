CS207-University of Regina Semester Project - A cellphone built from a raspberry pi running raspbian 
====================================================================================================
This project was created during the Fall Semester of 2014 for my Computer Science 207 class. In my search for a project I stumbled upon David Hunt's Raspberry Pi Phone, and was inspired to do my take on it and learn about cellular communication in the process.
